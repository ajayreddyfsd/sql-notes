-- correlated
-- iq cannot execute on its own unlike other SQs
-- need to run for each outer row by taking inputs from the same outer row
-- in this example, we used the same table for both outer and inner queries
-- writing inner query first helps a lot




--inner query
-- select max(from_date)
-- from salaries as i
-- where i.emp_no = o.emp_no



select *
from salaries as o
where from_date = (
    
    select max(from_date)
    from salaries as i
    where i.emp_no = o.emp_no
    
    );
